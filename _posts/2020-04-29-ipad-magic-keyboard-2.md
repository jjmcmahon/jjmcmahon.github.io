## So I'm in love with the Apple Magic Keyboard 2 for iPad
I have had my eye on the iPad Pro for quite some time now. I really like the 12.9 screen size and the mobility. I have a few co-workers using them for all kinds of different work from coding to daily tasks and this just added fuel to the fire. I figured that while we are all stuck at home during this pandemic, why not buy and iPad and get it set up. I initially purchased the iPad Pro 12.9 with the folio keyboard and it was great. I really enjoyed the mobility and I could leave my laptop docked in my office for work and use the iPad to supplement usage when I was helping the kids with their school work or when my wife needed to take a call for work. I enjoyed the adjustments I could make on the folio and was really happy with my purchase. Then a good friend and co-worker of mine who also has an iPad told me about the Magic Keyboard 2. Spoiler alert, I really really like it! Let’s take a look at the pros and cons...

## Pros

1. Trackpad

When I started using my iPad with the folio with a keyboard, it felt weird tapping things and then going back to the keyboard to type. It really through me off at first but after some time I got used to it. Now that I have a trackpad, this feels like a computer now. 

2. Keyboard

The key travel on this keyboard is amazing. The difference between it and the folio is night and day. I can type on this all day and it feels awesome. 

3. Adjustable Stand

The folio has two positions and it served for most purposes but I found that when sitting on the couch, the adjustment on the Magic Keyboard 2 is much better. It adjusts to whatever position I need. 

4. Backlit Keyboard

The backlit keyboard is a game changer at night. I really enjoy this and I honestly wasn’t sure that it would make much of a difference to me. 

## Cons

1. Price

The obvious thing that everyone seems to point out about the Magic Keyboard 2 is the price. It isn’t cheap. With that said, you probably aren’t buying an iPad unless you have some disposable income but with that said, if you’re looking for a tablet to come close to a laptop, this is pretty darn close. 

2. Weight

This thing isn’t light. I have the 12.9 iPad and with the Magic Keyboard 2, its not super light. With that said, I’m using it more like a laptop with this attached so its a fair trade off in my opinion. 

## Conclusion

I’m sure you could tell where this was going based on the title but I must say. I was skeptical due to the price and others mentioning the weight but I have honestly been blown away. I have really enjoyed this and device and it has truly enhanced my experience with the iPad. I would definitely give it a try.
