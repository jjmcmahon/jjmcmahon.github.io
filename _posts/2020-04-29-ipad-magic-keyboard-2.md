## So I'm in love with the Apple Magic Keyboard 2 for iPad
I have had my eye on the iPad Pro for quite some time now. I really like the 12.9 screen size and the mobility. I have a few co-workers using them for all kinds of different work from coding to daily tasks and this just added fuel to the fire. I figured that while we are all stuck at home during this pandemic, why not buy and iPad and get it set up. I initially purchased the iPad Pro 12.9 with the folio keyboard and it was great. I really enjoyed the mobility and I could leave my laptop docked in my office for work and use the iPad to supplement usage when I was helping the kids with their school work or when my wife needed to take a call for work. I enjoyed the adjustments I could make on the folio and was really happy with my purchase. Then a good friend and co-worker of mine who also has an iPad told me about the Magic Keyboard 2.
