## Everything's On Fire Blog Is Born
Hi, my name is JJ McMahon and I am your standard IT guy. I work at a large insurance company who knows a thing or two because we have seen a thing or two. The thoughts on this blog and elsewhere on the internet are my own. I will not be posting work stuff but more around the random projects i am working on and things that I am using at home and sometimes at work but no IP. I like to write but seldom follow a theme so I will try to tag things so you can find stuff you're interested in. The name of this blog is just something I thought was funny. Anywho, if you are reading this, cool. There are probably tons of other more productive things you could be doing but I appreciate you taking the time, :). 

I'm building this blog on Github Pages after my buddy Chris told me about his, pretty dope. I really dig the simple theme. All housed in my repo [my Github page](https://github.com/jjmcmahon/jjmcmahon.github.io).
